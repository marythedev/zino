**Feature #2: Product Showcase**: Engaging product showcase to highlight items with detailed descriptions, high-quality images and pricing information. The prototype currently displays a well designed home page with highlighted products from various categories that should allow for the promotion of items & maximizing sale opportunities. The Home page features the nav, where users can view different product categories and select the one they are interested in, which helps with product discoverability. The idea is to catch the consumer eye to bring their attention to certain items that may have higher clickthrough and sales.

## Future Aspirations
This project reflects our ability to take an idea from concept to reality using the MERN stack. It highlights our team’s flexibility and commitment to creating applications that are not only functional but also intuitive and appealing to the end users.

Looking ahead, we aim to enhance the system with **Data-Driven Insights & Tracking** through a dashboard for retail store owners, offering analytics on sales and customer behavior to help optimize inventory, forecast demand and support informed business decisions. We also plan to expand **Account Management** functionality, allowing users to track order history and receive personalized recommendations.
